<h1>The Georgia Public Service Commission Elections of 2025: The Primaries</h1>

<h2>Where are the engaged Democratic voters in Georgia right now?</h2>

<p>A few states have prominent off year elections, like New Jersey and Virginia, which are having their elections for governor and a few row offices this year. Georgia is not usually one of those, but due to some court cases there are some statewide elections this year in November--those for the Public Service Commission (PSC). Two seats are up for election, and only one of them had a contested Democratic primary--District 3, which makes up the core of the Atlanta metropolitan area. Confusingly, while commission officers must reside in their district, the officers are elected statewide. Therefore, the PSC primary elections are the first major statewide election in Georgia this year, and thus they're our first big signal of which voters are participating and engaged in the state. It's interesting to observe that the simultaneous Republican primary for PSC District 2 had only half as many voters (125,968 for the PSC District 3 D primary, vs. 63,340 for the PSC District 2 R primary).</p>

<p>Since it's an off-year and the PSC seats are not high-visibility offices, the voters who participate in the primary for the PSC election are likely to be the most engaged voters out of all voters in Georgia. Without party registration, the only numbers we can really compare to are actual vote choices in previous statewide elections. The most recent one would be the 2024 presidential election, where Kamala Harris received 2,548,017 votes. A raw calculation of overall % gives us a 'Democratic turnout' of 4.94% compared to 2024.</p>

<h2>How does this vary per county?</h2>  

<p>I've mapped this out in the image you see here.</p>

<p>Maybe unsurprisingly, most of the higher turnout counties are in the PSC districts actually on the ballot for this year. However, outside of the core of the Atlanta metro, and the highly educated Athens-Clarke County (home of the University of Georgia), urban counties appear to have lower turnout. North Georgia as a whole also had lower turnout. 
There is a large cluster of higher turnout counties in the central/eastern part of the state, and it's interesting that these, like most of the other higher turnout counties, are very rural.</p>

<h2> The runoff</h2>

<p>The runoff for the PSC District 3 Primary had a very different result than the first round: where in the first round Keisha Waites was ahead by 15 points, in the runoff (which had slightly fewer votes, at 112,702) Peter Hubbard came out ahead 58-42. Examining the vote totals we can see that Hubbard gained many more votes, whereas Waites actually *lost* voters compared to the first round. Much of this may be due to Hubbard's late campaigning, and Waites' controversies, but let's see if there are any interesting geographic tendencies in turnout rates. A visual inspection of the election map shows a stark North-South divide in Hubbard's vs. Waites' support.</p>

<p>What about turnout? Here's a map of counties colored by turnout relative to the first round of voting:</p>

<p>Most counties actually pretty much showed up the same in the runoff vs. round one! This is maybe not so surprising, because the small percentage of voters who are high engagement enough to show up for Public Service Commission primaries are probably going to keep up with the election outcomes as well. Thus they would also be aware of the need for a runoff.
</p>
 <br>
 <p>There also doesn't seem to be much going on geographically with which counties showed up for the runoff and which ones didn't: there are urban, suburban, and rural counties that lost voters; any kind of county also might have retained voters. Because we don't see any turnout effects, it probably is safe to say that Hubbard's win is due to persuasion of the voters who went for 'third candidates'. Waites simply could not assemble a larger coalition of support in round two, and so Hubbard took the votes for everyone else.</p>
