<h2>Tracking down an English Woozle</h2>

<p>In the world of <em>Winnie The Pooh</em>, a woozle is a mysterious kind of creature--Pooh and Piglet follow its tracks, which they keep finding in greater and greater numbers. They never find the creature despite searching for a long time. Actually they were walking in a circle, and the tracks of the woozle were their own footprints.</p> 
<br>
 <p>In science, an idea becomes a woozle when it appears with little actual support in a widely cited source, and often tertiary references are created. The wide range of citations thus makes the idea appear credible even though it has no strong evidence. In the study of the history of the English language, an example of a woozle is the word 'werman' meaning 'male human'.</p>
 
<h3>What's typically claimed in the popular literature</h3>
<br>
 <p> Here's a representative example, from p.45 of the book <em>How to Be Good with Words</em>: "Ironically enough, <em>man</em> originally had <em>human being</em> as its only meaning; in Old English a <em>werman</em> was a male adult human being, a <em>wifman</em> a female."</p> <br>

 <p>This book makes no citation to support this claim, as is typical. It is not common except perhaps in careful philological papers to cite the mere existence of a word, which is fine in most instances. Here it's problematic though because the word <em>werman</em> did not exist at all! Digital corpora exist that contain virtually all known texts in Old English, such as the Dictionary of Old English corpus from the University of Toronto. In this corpus, no instances of "werman" are found, nor is the word found in Hall's <em>Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary</em>. Given the breadth of these sources and how mundane the usage of a word for 'adult male human' must be, the fact that no examples are found can be taken as strong evidence that the word 'werman' simply did not exist. A Google search or another way of perusing discussions online will show that many other people have incorrectly (and without citation) claimed the existence of 'werman'. 
 </p>
<h3>What is the origin of this claim?</h3>
<p>Who's originally responsible for the false claim that Old English had such a word? Can we assign it to any particular person or is the data not so clear? Perhaps even it's a natural assumption that in addition to the word wifman (which really was real) there must "of course" be a word werman?

A reasonable first place to start is to search for such claims in texts and try to find the ones that were published the earliest. Our example, <em>How to Be Good with Words</em>, is from 2017, which is quite recent. But we can find much earlier examples! A <a href="https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3261&context=mainecampus">                                                                                                                                    'letter to the editor'</a> in the University of Maine's newspaper, from 1989, makes the same claim to the existence and meaning of 'werman' in Old English (see the entry "Knowing word origin helps"). Earlier examples are hard to find, but a single post to a university newspaper is hardly plausible as the source of a common misconception. On the other hand, several books on English style and usage from the 90s and early 2000s repeat the claim that 'werman' was the Old English word for 'adult male human', so by that time it was apparently a belief held by quite a few scholars. A <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/f4h0as/the_old_english_ghost_word_werman_where_did_this/">reddit thread</a> contains a comment which gives a few more examples from the 70s, and a curious passage from the 1800s via Christian Karl Barth. He claims the existence of a early German term 'Werman'.

Suppose for a moment that Barth is correctly reporting the existence of an early German word; in this instance we might find it compelling (by some kind of comparison) that it really did exist in Old English and for whatever reason it was lost very early on. This would not help those who we've seen claim its existence in English since none of them cited or mentioned Barth, so how should we know if they're even aware of him?
Moreover, German also has a word <em>Wehr</em> which may be translated as 'defense' or 'weapon', and thus the formation described by Barth might be analogous instead to the attested Old English waepnedman 'male human'; waepned meaning "armed", i.e. 'equipped with a weapon' (the intention of 'weapon' here is euphemistic for 'penis').
The Grimm Brothers' <em>Deutsches Worterbuch</em> (DWB) gives a word wehrmann which they gloss as 'kriegsmann', i.e. warrior; this demonstrates that such a formation actually existed in the history of the German language, and there might perhaps have been a variant Werman which would be the origin of Barth's word. As an occupational surname the frequently found Werman/Wermann probably has this as at least one of its etymologies. All things considered, Barth's claimed form Werman might just be spurious, or is an unrelated form.</p>
 <br>
<p>In any case, the evidence we can find that I've summarized here so far seems to support the idea (found in the reddit discussions) that werman was assumed by analogy: forms <em>wer</em> and <em>wif</em> really do exist, as does <em>wifman</em>, as the source of Modern English 'woman', so of course there must also be <em>*werman</em>. It is probably not possible to assign a particular person to be responsible for this incorrect inference, since we have found it in various sources that are difficult to connect to each other in the late 20th century. "Linguistically aware" people who had something to say about gendered words may have made this incorrect analogy multiple times independently. But why? What would cause someone to feel that such a word must exist? I'm going to suggest that the presence (or in reality the absence) of such a word in the historical record is important for a politically charged discussion about language use.</p>

<h2>Linguistic Markedness and Gender Politics</h2>
 <p>For much of history across the world women have been excluded from professional life; in English-speaking countries this means that terms for many occupations are typically gendered: fireman, businessman, etc. Since we now accept that women are not basically inferior and they should be allowed to choose the career they wish, it is not necessarily true anymore that someone who owns or works at a business firm, someone who stops fires, etc. would be a man. Many have suggested that the traditional terms are not always precisely accurate because of this situation, and so we should rightfully use other terms like firefighter, businesswoman, and so on.
 Those who object to changing terms often say that the word 'man' is traditionally gender neutral. So there's actually no problem, because the original term can just as well refer to women, even if it sounds awkward.</p>
