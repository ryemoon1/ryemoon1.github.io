<h2>Tracking down an English Woozle</h2>

<p>In the world of <em>Winnie The Pooh</em>, a woozle is a mysterious kind of creature--Pooh and Piglet follow its tracks, which they keep finding in greater and greater numbers. They never find the creature despite searching for a long time. Actually they were walking in a circle, and the tracks of the woozle were their own footprints.</p> 
<br>
 <p>In science, an idea becomes a woozle when it appears with little actual support in a widely cited source, and often tertiary references are created. The wide range of citations thus makes the idea appear credible even though it has no strong evidence.</p>
