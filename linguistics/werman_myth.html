<h2>Tracking down an English Woozle</h2>

<p>In the world of <em>Winnie The Pooh</em>, a woozle is a mysterious kind of creature--Pooh and Piglet follow its tracks, which they keep finding in greater and greater numbers. They never find the creature despite searching for a long time. Actually they were walking in a circle, and the tracks of the woozle were their own footprints.</p> 
<br>
 <p>In science, an idea becomes a woozle when it appears with little actual support in a widely cited source, and often tertiary references are created. The wide range of citations thus makes the idea appear credible even though it has no strong evidence. In the study of the history of the English language, an example of a woozle is the word 'werman' meaning 'male human'.</p>
 
<h3>What's typically claimed in the popular literature</h3>
<br>
 <p> Here's a representative example, from p.45 of the book <em>How to Be Good with Words</em>: "Ironically enough, <em>man</em> originally had <em>human being</em> as its only meaning; in Old English a <em>werman</em> was a male adult human being, a <em>wifman</em> a female."</p> <br>

 <p>This book makes no citation to support this claim, as is typical. It is not common except in careful philological papers to cite the mere existence of a word, which is fine in most instances. Here it's problematic though because the word <em>werman</em> did not exist at all!</p>
