<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>This is my website! Here you'll eventually (hopefully soon!) find my thoughts, analyses, and research on a few different topics. <br> Most commonly you'll probably find things about 
 language and linguistics, election data, and maybe some math.</p>

<h2>Some stuff, just for testing</h2>

 I made this image using QGIS, and the source of my data was the Georgia Secretary of State's office.
