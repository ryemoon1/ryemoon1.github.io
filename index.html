<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>This is my website! Here you'll eventually (hopefully soon!) find my thoughts, analyses, and research on a few different topics. <br> I do research on certain topics for my job, but professionally I'm constrained by the goals and interests of my employer. I have other interests though! <br> So that's what you'll find on this website. Right now I have some content about elections/politics, and about languages/linguistics, but maybe some day there will be some about other things. <br> Explore the sections below to see what I've written!</p>

<h2>Linguistics</h2>
<p>My specialization in this field is definitely historical linguistics. More particularly, you'll probably find most of the writings here about Austronesian languages, and other languages in East Asia/the Pacific, although I have a mild interest in the history of almost all languages in the world.</p>
 
<h2>Elections and Politics</h2>
 
<p>I live in the state of Georgia in the US, so many of the elections analyzed here will be in that state, or perhaps even in states that are nearby. That's simply what's most local to me and what I most care about! <br> P.S.: If you learn or find out who my employer is, of course nothing I say about politics here should be construed as the views of my employer or the organization I work for!</p>
